# Dinopedia
A Spring Boot project that demonstrates a plat a social sharing platform where users can share their favorite movies.
It is written using Java 17 and the services are exposed with a REST API.

### Get the application up & running 
From the terminal of you IDE or from a terminal window in the directory of Dinopedia (where the docker-compose file exists), run the command `docker-compose up`. Now you can access the endpoints on your `localhost:8080`.

## Understanding and Testing the application
The documentation and the endpoints collection were exported from Postman. 
- Here you may find the [Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7555836/2s8YsnWb3Y)
- and the [Postman Collection](https://github.com/dinos217/dinopedia/files/10071248/Dinopedia.Endpoints.postman_collection.zip)

## Tip: 
First things first: Create a user through the register endpoint you will find in Documentation (preferably with the role ADMIN) so you can access all the endpoints available.
